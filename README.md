## Next Up

- One-way synchronization of my Wunderlist shopping list.
- Some kind of authentication system.
- Migrate the recipes system here.
- Sonos integration? Or not?

## The Wunderlist/Barcode Design

When creating "to buys" using the barcode scanner we call the repositories/wunderlist creating a task of the form "<product name> (<isbn #>)". The mapping from ISBN -> Product name (and hopefully some metadata) remains a mystery but in the worst case we have to maintain a database table with this mapping.

## TODO (long term)

- One-way synchronization of some calendars.
- Meniga integration.
- Profiles.
